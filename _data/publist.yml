- title: "Tackling challenges related to Activity and Time-based costing"
  image: 
  description: |
  Activity-based costing (ABC) and time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) 
  are two types of costing systems. We have developed an analytical comparison which generates 
  formulas that describe how each system maps resources to activities and finally to products. 
  In our numerical experiment TDABC is more accurate than ABC when traceability of resources 
  to activities is high and activity traceability to products is low, while ABC is more accurate 
  when activities are more traceable to products, irrespective of the level of resource traceability 
  to activities. To improve the costing system, we examined first of all the impact of hybridizing
  an ABC (TDABC) system with TDABC (ABC). Our efforts on hybridizing showed that adding one ABC
  element into a TDABC system usually improves accuracy.
  
  Further, we evaluated interaction as a means to reduce time estimation error. We tested the joint 
  impact of task interruption and interactive time estimation on the accuracy of time estimates. As 
  predicted, we find that the negative impact of task interruption on time estimation accuracy is 
  mitigated when participants are allowed to interactively discuss their time estimates before making
  a final time estimate alone. By explaining our findings through the underlying effects of cognitive
  load and confidence, we are able to provide managers ways to improve the accuracy of their time-based
  costing systems by enabling an interactive time estimation process to offset the detrimental effect 
  of task interruption.

- title: "Eco-controls for sustainable"
  image: 
  description: "Internal accounting information serves two primary roles: (i) to support decision-making, 
  (ii) to decision-influencing or control role. In particular, environmental management accounting encompasses 
  the provision of information to manage environmental performance. Management controls are designed 'to ensure 
  that the behaviour of employees is consistent with the organization’s objectives and strategy'. In the context
  of the environment, we view environmental controls or eco-controls as mechanisms used to direct organizational 
  members as well as other stakeholders such that they perform activities that contribute to the achievement of 
  organizations’ environmental objectives and the implementation of their related strategies. We have studied 
  prior research on eco-control practices and obtained critical reflections and avenues for future work."

- title: "The Effectiveness of Conceptual Models Auto-Generated from a Set of User Stories Written as BDD Scenarios: A Proposed Study"
  image: 
  description: While agile methodologies are commonly used in software development, researchers have identified many issues related to requirements elicitation in agile projects. Some of these issues relate to the complexity of managing and understanding user stories, which is a widely used requirements specification mechanism in Agile methodologies. This research proposes the automatic generation of conceptual models from the user stories and the corresponding Behavior-Driven Development acceptance criteria to help managing and understanding user stories. This paper discusses a proposed study to evaluate the usefulness of the auto-generated conceptual models from the user stories.

- title: "Sharing platform ontology development : proof-of-concept"
  image: 
  description: A sharing platform is a digital platform that facilitates access to underutilized goods by renting or lending them to others. Users become less dependent on ownership which improves efficiency, sustainability, and the sense of community. The Sharing Economy (SE) is considered a complex domain because value co-creation can occur between multiple types of platform users. Developing platform software that offers the right functionality for the intended digital platform is therefore challenging. To address this complexity, an ontology can be utilized, which is an explicit specification of a conceptualization that provides a controlled vocabulary and shared meaning regarding a domain. The use of a sharing platform ontology allows for more effective communication and knowledge sharing amongst stakeholders in platform development and eventually drives the platform software development process. However, currently, it is not known how to develop such an ontology. In previous research, we developed the Digital Platform Ontology (DPO) and an extension of the DPO for describing platform business model choices. The DPO describes the digital platform domain in terms of digital platform types, including sharing platforms. However, a method to use the DPO and its business model extension for developing an organization-specific ontology that describes the functionality and business model of a specific existing or intended sharing platform was lacking. In this paper, we develop such a method using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and demonstrate it using a proof-of-concept based on the BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing platforms.

- title: "Ambiguity in user stories : a systematic literature review"
  image: 
  description: "Context - Ambiguity in user stories is a problem that has received little research attention. Due to the absence of review studies, it is not known how and to what extent this problem, which impacts the effectiveness of user stories in supporting systems development, has been solved. Objectives: We review the studies that investigate or develop solutions for problems related to ambiguity in user stories. We investigate how these problems manifest themselves, what their causes and consequences are, what solutions have been proposed and what evidence of their effectiveness has been presented. Based on the insights we obtain from this review, we identify research gaps and suggest opportunities for future research. Methods - We followed Systematic Literature Review guidelines to review problems investigated, solutions proposed, and validation/evaluation methods used. We classified the reviewed studies according to the four linguistic levels of ambiguity (i.e., lexical, syntactic, semantic, pragmatic) proposed by Berry and Kamsties to obtain insights from patterns that we observe in the classification of problems and solutions. Results - A total of 36 studies published in 2001-2020 investigated ambiguity in user stories. Based on four patterns we discern, we identify three research gaps. First, we need more research on human behaviors and cognitive factors causing ambiguity. Second, ambiguity is seldom studied as a problem of a set of related user stories, like a theme or epic in Scrum. Third, there is a lack of holistic solution approaches that consider ambiguity at multiple linguistic levels. Conclusion - Ambiguity in user stories is a known problem. However, a comprehensive solution for addressing ambiguity in a set of related user stories as it manifests itself at different linguistic levels as a cognitive problem is lacking."
