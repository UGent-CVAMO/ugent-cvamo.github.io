- title: "Tackling challenges related to Activity and Time-based costing"
  image: timeestimation.png
  description: "Activity-based costing (ABC) and time-driven activity-based costing (TDABC) 
  are two types of costing systems. We have developed an analytical comparison which generates 
  formulas that describe how each system maps resources to activities and finally to products. 
  In our numerical experiment TDABC is more accurate than ABC when traceability of resources 
  to activities is high and activity traceability to products is low, while ABC is more accurate 
  when activities are more traceable to products, irrespective of the level of resource traceability 
  to activities. To improve the costing system, we examined first of all the impact of hybridizing
  an ABC (TDABC) system with TDABC (ABC). Our efforts on hybridizing showed that adding one ABC
  element into a TDABC system usually improves accuracy.
  \
  Further, we evaluated interaction as a means to reduce time estimation error. We tested the joint 
  impact of task interruption and interactive time estimation on the accuracy of time estimates. As 
  predicted, we find that the negative impact of task interruption on time estimation accuracy is 
  mitigated when participants are allowed to interactively discuss their time estimates before making
  a final time estimate alone. By explaining our findings through the underlying effects of cognitive
  load and confidence, we are able to provide managers ways to improve the accuracy of their time-based
  costing systems by enabling an interactive time estimation process to offset the detrimental effect 
  of task interruption."

- title: "Eco-controls for sustainable"

  description: "Internal accounting information serves two primary roles: (i) to support decision-making, 
  (ii) to decision-influencing or control role. In particular, environmental management accounting encompasses 
  the provision of information to manage environmental performance. Management controls are designed 'to ensure 
  that the behaviour of employees is consistent with the organization’s objectives and strategy'. In the context
  of the environment, we view environmental controls or eco-controls as mechanisms used to direct organizational 
  members as well as other stakeholders such that they perform activities that contribute to the achievement of 
  organizations’ environmental objectives and the implementation of their related strategies. We have studied 
  prior research on eco-control practices and obtained critical reflections and avenues for future work."

- title: "B2BBoost - Understanding to mitigate customer churn"
  image: 
  description: "Within the field of customer relationship management (CRM), it is known that attracting new customers 
  is much more expensive than retaining existing customers. As a result, customer churn prediction (CCP) models have 
  been created. We developed an B2B-specific profit driven metric, called the Expected Maximum Profit measure for B2B 
  (EMPB) based on EMPC originally developed for B2C. Using this model, we demonstrated how current practices are 
  suboptimal due to large discrepancies in customer value. Therefore, to directly incorporate the heterogeneity of customer
  values and profit concerns of the company, we introduced an instance-dependent profit maximizing classifier based on 
  gradient boosting, named B2Boost. B2Boost considers these differences in value and incorporates them into the 
  model construction by maximizing the objective function in terms of the EMPB. Our algorithm outperforms more 
  traditional methods such as Random Forest."

- title: "Servitisation through digital marketplaces - ontology based model"
  image: 
  description: "Industry 4.0 will lead to new business models including servitisation. Digital marketplaces are digital 
  platforms that may operate under a large variety of business models incl. a servitised business. As taxonomies typically 
  fall short in describing platform user roles and role-specific digital platform functionality, we developed a 
  Digital Platform Ontology (DPO) and extended it with digital platform business model ontology modules, based on an 
  analysis of digital marketplace business models. The new ontology modules can be used as building blocks to model 
  a digital marketplace operating under a chosen business model."
