- title: "The Effectiveness of Conceptual Models Auto-Generated from a Set of User Stories Written as BDD Scenarios: A Proposed Study"
  image: 
  description: While agile methodologies are commonly used in software development, researchers have identified many issues related to requirements elicitation in agile projects. Some of these issues relate to the complexity of managing and understanding user stories, which is a widely used requirements specification mechanism in Agile methodologies. This research proposes the automatic generation of conceptual models from the user stories and the corresponding Behavior-Driven Development acceptance criteria to help managing and understanding user stories. This paper discusses a proposed study to evaluate the usefulness of the auto-generated conceptual models from the user stories.

 - title: "Sharing platform ontology development : proof-of-concept"
  image: 
  description: A sharing platform is a digital platform that facilitates access to underutilized goods by renting or lending them to others. Users become less dependent on ownership which improves efficiency, sustainability, and the sense of community. The Sharing Economy (SE) is considered a complex domain because value co-creation can occur between multiple types of platform users. Developing platform software that offers the right functionality for the intended digital platform is therefore challenging. To address this complexity, an ontology can be utilized, which is an explicit specification of a conceptualization that provides a controlled vocabulary and shared meaning regarding a domain. The use of a sharing platform ontology allows for more effective communication and knowledge sharing amongst stakeholders in platform development and eventually drives the platform software development process. However, currently, it is not known how to develop such an ontology. In previous research, we developed the Digital Platform Ontology (DPO) and an extension of the DPO for describing platform business model choices. The DPO describes the digital platform domain in terms of digital platform types, including sharing platforms. However, a method to use the DPO and its business model extension for developing an organization-specific ontology that describes the functionality and business model of a specific existing or intended sharing platform was lacking. In this paper, we develop such a method using the Design Science Research Methodology (DSRM) and demonstrate it using a proof-of-concept based on the BlaBlaCar and Couchsurfing platforms.
