# Open positions

**Note: We currently don't have funding for additional PhD and postdoc positions. We can only welcome you if you have a fellowship. I'd be happy to support you after you apply to our group.**



We are always looking for new group members with passion, talent, and grit!


### Applications for PhD and Postdoc positions
If you are interested in working with us as a PhD student or postdoc, please send me an [email](mailto:dries.benoit@ugent.be). State briefly why you are interested and attach a CV, including information about the grades you had as an undergraduate. No need for a separate cover letter or certificates. **Important**: please insert _"Application PhD"_ or _"Application Postdoc"_ in the subject line. If you are applying to a specific advertisement, note this in your email.


### Master projects for Ghent University students
If you are a Master student at Ghent University looking for a Master project, contact me (or any group member) per email or stop by my office.
